    <p>The oyster dress is a high fashion gown created by British fashion designer Alexander McQueen for his
        Spring/Summer 2003 collection Irere. McQueen's design is a one-shouldered dress in bias-cut beige silk chiffon
        with a boned upper body and a full-length skirt consisting of hundreds of individual circles of organza sewn in
        dense layers to the base fabric, resembling an oyster shell. The dress originated as a reinterpretation of the
        "shellfish dress" designed by John Galliano in 1987, which McQueen had long admired and sought to emulate.
        Contemporary critical responses to McQueen's oyster dress were positive and it is considered an iconic piece of
        McQueen's work. Only two copies are known to exist, one held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York
